# Taylor Series Visualization 
A python project that visualizes how Taylor polynominal approximates a function.
The project plots the orginal function and its Taylor approximation of different orders so you
can clearly see convergence, diverengence, and behavior near the expansion point.

# Features
-Visualize the taylor series approximation for any function
-Plots Taylor polynominal of different orders n(1,2,3,4,...)
-Choose expansion point 'a'
-Supports common functions (sin, cos, e^x...etc)

#Used technologies
-Python 3
-Numpy(for generating points + computing approximations)
-MatPlotLib(for Plotting functions)
